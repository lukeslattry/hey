# Hey
### The Anonymous Slack Interface.

## Set Up:
1. Create an Incoming Webhook in the Custom Integrations sections of your Slack account. Make sure it is linked to a new, dedicated channel.
2. Paste the Webhooks URI into the script.js file where commented.
3. That's it. You're sorted!

###*WARNING:*
This will make your Webhook URI publicly visible. Using a dedicated channel for Hey will reduce effect of spamming, but you have been warning.
